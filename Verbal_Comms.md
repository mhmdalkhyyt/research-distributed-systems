## Single channel Hypothesis
    One thing at a time!

    * people focus on only one thing at a time.
    * Speaker leads audience attention.


## How to lead attention

    * Take the perspective of your audience.
    * Make things concrete.
    * Humor is important
        - SEX is even better!
    * Create an emotion.

## Prepare
    1. Whos your audience?
    2. Whats you message?
    3. Whats is relevant for your audience?
        a) State questions that your audicence would ask.
        b) Prioritize questions.
        c) Respond to them (in a way the can understand).


## Other Prepare

    * Rehearsal!
    * Keywords are better than the full script.
    * Check your enviorment before going on stage.
    * Consider other things that may affect your performance.

## Are you nervous?
    * Some nervoisity is good enough
    * Come prepared
    * Remember that you feel more nervous that you sound good
    * Use your supporting tools.
        - PowerPoint-slides etc.
    * Leave your hands empty.

## Slide design
    Slides are for the audience audience 
    NOT FOR YOU!

    * 6*6 rule (rows*col)
    * 5-8 slides/15mins

## How to start
    * Do NOT speak until you have the audiences attention
    * Starting steps:
        1. Talk some nonsense.
        2. Raise attention.
        3. Make the real beginning clear.
        4. Say your name.
        5. Do not forget your title!
        6. Give the audience time to catch the topic.

## Things to consider

    * Pay attention to your audience.
    * Speak to your audience, not to the board.
    * Establish eye contact (briefly).
    * Come with a positive attitude.
    * Do not be afraid to take breaks.
        - It creates variations.
    * Things to do - things to say!

## Your voice

    * Speak loud and clear.
    * Believe in what you are going to say.

     Some things to avoid.
    * High pitch, too loud.
    * End sentences with reduced volume.
    * Monotone speech.

## How to move your
    * Move, but not too much:
      * Standing completely still is just as bad as running

    * Avoid bad habits:
      * E.g. swinging.
  
    * Stand on your own:
      * Do not lean on something.


## How to end 

    * Finish when...
      * Time is up, or
      * You do not have anything more to say

    * Wrap up before you finish:
      * Summary is good but not always necessary.
      * Wriapping up will increase attention.


## Show respect

    * Do not be afraid of sounding dumb:
      * It's the speakers responsibility to present things in a way you understand

    * Ask a question:
      * Avoid simply commenting.
  
    * Come with a constructive attitude.
