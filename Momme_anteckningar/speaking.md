### Problem description and cloud explain

    We are researching the possibility offering the ability to monitor the wellbeing of agricultural practices in third world countries. 
    
    Big names in IT have been promoting the idea of that computers and computer science is supposed to be available for everyone and everywhere since the early days of this field.

    Our goal is to provide solution to the farmers to increase their produce efficiency while at the same time lower their overall costs. 

    As many groups today will explain what is the cloud? 
    Cloud is: Computing resources provided as a service to clients connected via network. 

    Therefore, the architecture of the cloud needs to be built with service-oriented architecture that provide uptime to clients.

    Clients workspaces are hosted on a viritual environment where redundancy is taken into consideration. 



### Business model

    A cloud service provider, offers services to customers with a variety of payment methods, such as "pay as you go" structure. 

    The clientele spans from private individuals storing their vacation pictures, spanning to small, medium or bigger companies with various needs such as dashboards, platforms, storage, managing systems, etc.

    Potential customers can be companies that need to upgrade their business with technologies for their operations. 

### Edge computing

    As aforementioned a usage of cloud based computing is to remotly operate an enviorment with multiple connected client-devices. These devices are connected to the network. 

    The devices complexity range is vast:
    1. Simple sensors providing readings to a host device where computation is done. 
    2. A device where computation is done partialy localy on the device, then sent over to the cloud. 

    These devices are called edge-devices where they recide in the edge of the cloud architecture.

    Opportunities are vast, and today we explore an application...


### Strawberry

    An article published 5 august 2022 named Smart Strawberry Farming Using Edge Computing and IoT.

    The article explores an opportunity to try to monitor the health of strawberries grown on a farm in Brazil, using A.I. backed by edge devices.

    L1: Sensor nodes in the ground monitoring vital moisture and other feedback depending on sensors used.


    L2: Collector nodes using computer vision software to monitor the plants during pre-harvest stage. Data is stored in a local database.

    L3: Remote cloud connection collecting sensor data, crop/yield information, image services, dashboards and data storage.

    L4: Remote web based apps for the user applications, where feedback is provided to the farmers. Providing analytics and other useful information.
